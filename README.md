The following is a simple application that uses OIDC for authentication.

You can test it out by doing:

1. Start the Application

    `mvn spring-boot:run`
    
2. Browse to `http://localhost:8080` and log in as `josh` / `password`

The result will be a greeting page that says "Hello, josh@example.com!"
